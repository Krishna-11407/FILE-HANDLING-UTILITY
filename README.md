## Project Description

As a developer, I created this File Management System to provide users with a powerful yet intuitive interface for handling their files. This Java-based application showcases my ability to implement effective file handling operations while maintaining a user-friendly command-line interface.

I designed this system with the primary goal of making file operations accessible and efficient. The application allows users to perform essential file operations including creation, reading, updating, and deletion of files. One of the key features I implemented is the flexibility in file creation - users can create files either in the current directory or specify a custom location, with the system automatically handling directory creation if needed.

Throughout the development process, I utilized Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE, taking advantage of its powerful Java extensions and debugging capabilities. ChatGPT proved to be an invaluable assistant, helping me optimize the code structure and implement best practices. I also extensively used online resources including Google, Stack Overflow, and Java Documentation to ensure the implementation followed industry standards.

The system's architecture is built on Java's robust file handling capabilities, utilizing classes like File, FileWriter, and Scanner to perform various operations. I implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the code to ensure the system remains stable even when unexpected situations occur. The user interface was designed with simplicity in mind, featuring clear menu structures and proper input validation to prevent user errors.

One of the challenges I faced during development was ensuring proper file path handling across different operating systems. I addressed this by implementing Java's built-in path handling capabilities and creating clear error messages to guide users when they encounter path-related issues. The system also includes features for reading file contents, updating files by appending content, and securely deleting files with proper verification.
